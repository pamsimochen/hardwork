<H1><A NAME="Preprocessing">Preprocessing</A></H1><HR>

<P>The translator processes each source file in a series of phases.
<B>Preprocessing</B> constitutes the earliest phases, which produce a
<A HREF="#translation unit">translation unit</A>.
Preprocessing treats a source file as a sequence of
<A HREF="lib_file.html#text lines">text lines</A>. You can specify
<B><A NAME="directives">directives</A></B> and
<B><A NAME="macros">macros</A></B>
that insert, delete, and alter source text.</P>

<P>This document describes briefly just those aspects
of preprocessing most relevant to the use of the Standard C library:</P>

<P>The macro <CODE><A NAME="__FILE__">__FILE__</A></CODE>
expands to a
<A HREF="charset.html#string literal">string literal</A>
that gives the remembered
<A HREF="lib_over.html#filename">filename</A>
of the current source file. You can alter the value of this macro
by writing a
<A HREF="#line directive"><I>line</I> directive</A>.</P>

<P>The macro <CODE><A NAME="__LINE__">__LINE__</A></CODE>
expands to a decimal integer constant
that gives the remembered line number within the current source file.
You can alter the value of this macro by writing a
<A HREF="#line directive"><I>line</I> directive</A>.</P>

<P>The name <CODE><A NAME="__func__">__func__</A></CODE>
(added with <A HREF="lib_over.html#C99">C99</A>) is effectively
declared at the beginning of each function body as:</P>

<PRE>static const char __func__[] = "func_name";</PRE>

<P>where <CODE>func_name</CODE> is the name of the function.</P>

<P>A <B><A NAME="define directive"><I>define</I> directive</A></B>
defines a name as a macro.
Following the directive name <CODE>define</CODE>,
you write one of two forms:</P>

<UL>
<LI>a name <I>not</I> immediately followed by a left parenthesis,
followed by any sequence of preprocessing tokens -- to define a
macro without parameters

<LI>a name immediately followed by a left parenthesis with <I>no</I>
intervening white space, followed by zero or more distinct <I>parameter
names</I> separated by commas, followed by a right parenthesis, followed
by any sequence of preprocessing tokens -- to define a macro with
as many parameters as names that you write inside the parentheses
</UL>

<P>You can selectively skip groups of lines
within source files by writing an
<B><A NAME="if directive"><I>if</I> directive</A></B>,
or one of the other <B>conditional directives</B>,
<I>ifdef</I> or <I>ifndef.</I>
You follow the conditional directive by the first group of lines
that you want to selectively skip.
Zero or more <I>elif</I> directives follow this first group of lines,
each followed by a group of lines that you want to selectively skip.
An optional <I>else</I> directive follows all groups of lines controlled
by <I>elif</I> directives, followed by the last group of lines you want
to selectively skip.
The last group of lines ends with an <I>endif</I> directive.</P>

<P>At most one group of lines is retained in the translation unit --
the one immediately preceded by a directive whose
<A HREF="#if expression"><I>#if</I> expression</A> has a nonzero value.
For the directive:</P>

<PRE>#ifdef X</PRE>

<P>this expression is <CODE>defined (X)</CODE>, and for the directive:</P>

<PRE>#ifndef X</PRE>

<P>this expression is <CODE>!defined (X)</CODE>.</P>

<P>A <B><A NAME="if expression"><I>#if</I> expression</A></B> is a
conditional expression that the preprocessor evaluates.
You can write only
<A HREF="express.html#integer constant expression">
integer constant expressions</A>, with the following
additional considerations:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The expression <CODE>defined X</CODE>, or <CODE>defined (X)</CODE>,
is replaced by 1 if <CODE>X</CODE> is defined as a macro, otherwise 0.

<LI>You cannot write the
<A HREF="express.html#sizeof operator"><I>sizeof</I></A>
or <I>type cast</I> operators. (The translator expands all macro
names, then replaces each remaining name with 0,
before it recognizes keywords.)

<LI>The translator may be able to represent a broader range of integers
than the target environment.

<LI>The translator represents type <I>int</I> the same as <I>long,</I>
and <I>unsigned int</I> the same as <I>unsigned long.</I>

<LI>The translator can translate character constants to a set of
code values different from the set for the target environment.
</UL>

<P>An <B><A NAME="include directive"><I>include</I> directive</A></B>
includes the contents of a
<A HREF="lib_over.html#standard headers">standard header</A>
or another source file in a translation unit. The contents of
the specified standard header or source file replace the <I>include</I>
directive. Following the directive name <CODE>include</CODE>,
write one of the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI>a standard header name between angle brackets

<LI>a filename between double quotes

<LI>any other form that expands to one of the two previous forms
after macro replacement
</UL>

<P>A <B><A NAME="line directive"><I>line</I> directive</A></B> alters
the source line number and filename used by the predefined macros
<A HREF="#__FILE__"><CODE>__FILE__</CODE></A> and
<A HREF="#__FILE__"><CODE>__FILE__</CODE></A>.
Following the directive name <CODE>line</CODE>,
write one of the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI>a decimal integer (giving the new line number of the line following)

<LI>a decimal integer as before, followed by a string literal (giving
the new line number and the new source filename)

<LI>any other form that expands to one of the two previous forms
after macro replacement
</UL>

<P>Preprocessing translates each source file in a series of distinct
<B><A NAME="Phases of Translation">phases</A></B>.
The first few phases of translation:
terminate each line with a newline character (<CODE><I>NL</I></CODE>),
convert trigraphs to their single-character equivalents,
and concatenate each line ending in a backslash (<CODE>\</CODE>)
with the line following. Later phases process
<A HREF="#include directive">include directives</A>,
expand macros, and so on to produce a
<B><A NAME="translation unit">translation unit</A></B>.
The translator combines separate translation units,
with contributions as needed from the
<A HREF="index.html#Standard C Library">Standard C library</A>, at
<B><A NAME="link time">link time</A></B>, to form the executable
<B><A NAME="program">program</A></B>.</P>

<P> An <B><A NAME="undef directive"><I>undef</I> directive</A></B>
removes a macro definition. You might want to
remove a macro definition so that you can define it differently with
a <I>define</I> directive or to unmask any other meaning given to
the name. The name whose definition you want to remove
follows the directive name <CODE>undef</CODE>.
If the name is not currently defined as a macro,
the <I>undef</I> directive has no effect.</P>
