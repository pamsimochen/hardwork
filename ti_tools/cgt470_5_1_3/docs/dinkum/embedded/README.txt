The Dinkum C/EC++ Library Reference is Copyright (c) 1992-2003
by P.J. Plauger. This code is protected by copyright. ALL
RIGHTS RESERVED.

Version 4.02. This set of files constitutes the entire Dinkum
C/EC++ Library Reference. It is for use only by the licensed
user. See the file crit_pjp.html (reachable via the Copyright
hot link at the bottom of every page) for detailed restrictions.

INSTALLATION AND USE

Extract this archive into any directory. The home page for the
entire Reference is the file index.html. Under Windows, you
can create a desktop icon with Windows Explorer. Right click on
the display for index.html and choose Create Shortcut. Right
click on the display for the created shortcut and choose Rename.
You can then enter a more meaningful name for the icon, such as
``Dinkum Embedded C++ Reference.'' Drag the shortcut onto the
desktop and drop it there.

If you find that none of the hot links work from the home page,
check the file names. A system that supports long file names
generally requires that the names of web pages end in .html.
Some older utilities truncate these endings to .htm, however.
The DOS/Windows command:

ren *.htm *.html

makes all the necessary changes.

Dinkumware, Ltd. and P.J. Plauger (“Licensor”) retain exclusive
ownership of this Product. It is licensed to you (“Licensee”) in
accordance with the terms specifically stated in this Notice. You

certain rights peculiar to computer software under copyright law.
In particular:

-- You may make one or more backup copies of the Product for
archival purposes.

-- You may permanently transfer ownership of the Product to another

This copy of the Product is licensed for use by a limited number of
developers, which is specified as part of the packaging for this
Product. A license for up to ten users, for example, limits to ten
the number of developers reasonably able to use the Product at any
instant of time. Thus, ten is the maximum number of POSSIBLE
concurrent users, not the number of ACTUAL concurrent users. A
single-user license is for use by just one developer.

Anyone who accesses this software has a moral responsibility not to
aid or abet illegal copying by others. Licensor recognizes that the
machine-readable format of the Product makes it particularly

Such use is permitted only so long as Licensee does not exceed the
maximum number of possible concurrent users and takes reasonable
precautions to protect the Product against unauthorized copying and
against public access. In particular, please note that the ability
to ACCESS this copy does not imply permission to USE it or to COPY
it. Please note also that Licensor has expended considerable
professional effort in the production of this Product, and continues
to do so to keep it current.

Licensor warrants that the Product as shipped performs substantially
in accordance with its documented purpose, and that the medium on
which the Product is provided is free from defects in material and
workmanship. To the extent permitted by law, any implied warranties
on the Product are limited to 90 days.

Licensor's entire liability under this warranty shall be, at
Licensor's option, either to refund the license fee paid by
Licensee or to replace the medium on which the Product is provided.
This is also Licensee's exclusive remedy. To qualify for this
remedy, Licensee must demonstrate satisfactory proof of purchase to
Licensor and return the Product in reasonably good condition to
Licensor.

LICENSOR OTHERWISE MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE
SUITABILITY OF THIS PRODUCT, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. LICENSOR
SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY LICENSEE AS A
RESULT OF USING THIS PRODUCT, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL
DAMAGES.

By using this Product, you agree to abide by the intellectual
property laws and all other applicable laws of the USA, and the
