#  ======== xdcpaths.mak ========
#  definition of XDC paths and commands
#
#  This makefile constructs the "search path" for the XDCtools where it finds
#  numerous components and packages needed to build examples and
#  programs.  See examples/build_instructions.html for general details about
#  this file.
#
#  USER NOTE:
#  1) you can remove some of the devices from the "DEVICE" list to reduce
#     the build time (and possibly avoid checking for presence of a component
#     you don't need)

#
# Note, this is a space-delimited list.
#
#DEVICE := OMAP3530 OMAPL138 OMAP4430 C6472 C6474 TI816X TI814X C6678 C6670 TI813X
DEVICE := TI813X

# Set this to your FC installation dir
FC_INSTALL_DIR = _your_FC_folder_/framework_components_3_30_00_06

# Pre-pend these vars to what products.mak's .show-products prints
.show-products::
	@echo "DEVICE                      = $(DEVICE)"
	@echo "FC_INSTALL_DIR              = $(FC_INSTALL_DIR)"
