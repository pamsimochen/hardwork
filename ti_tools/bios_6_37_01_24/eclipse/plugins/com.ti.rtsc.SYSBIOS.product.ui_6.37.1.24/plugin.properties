example_0_title = Minimal
example_0_description = This example has a fairly minimal .cfg which is set up for a static application where all objects are defined statically (via configuration tool and/or target structures).  Dynamic memory allocation has been disabled. The .cfg file creates a single task which has a couple of print statements and a Task_sleep() call.

example_1_title = Typical
example_1_description = This example has a .cfg populated with a typical set of options and parameters.  This .cfg file is a good starting point for many applications.  Dyanamic memory allocation and runtime create of is supported.  Unlike the 'Minimal' example, the single task is created at runtime using the Task_create() API.

example_2_title = Typical (with separate config project)
example_2_description = Same as the 'Typical' example except that the configuration project is a separate project from the app project.
