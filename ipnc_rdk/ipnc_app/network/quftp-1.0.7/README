This is my FTP client for Linux only.

I wrote this client out of frustration not being able to get a decent
FTP client for linux that does queueing.

I can almost guarantee that there are bugs in this thing, but it seems
to be reasonably stable here, and I can use it for my day-to-day FTP
needs. If you find any bugs, or have any comments, please let me know
at david@dparrish.com.

COMPILING:
	make

INSTALLING:
	make install
	cp example.quftprc ~/.quftprc

USING:
	quftp -h

	type "help" to get a list of commands in the program

Feel free to modify the .quftprc file to your liking, there are
instructions included in the file.

Should be sufficiently easy. You must have the GNU readline 4.0 libraries
installed with the headers in /usr/include/readline. (That's the place
for it in Red Hat). If you are getting segfaults logging in, it's probably
because you have an older version of readline installed. This is something
I would love to fix.

I don't plan on porting to Windows because it's not worth it.. there
are plenty of good FTP clients for Windows 95, such as Bulletproof FTP
(http://www.bpftp.com/). I don't have access to any *NIX systems other
than Linux, but if you want to port it to anything else, go ahead,
just let me know, preferably with patches.

Script files can be created as just plain text files. These can contain
any valid quftp command, which will be run one after the other. Run the
script with the -s parameter or the run command. If any command fails,
script processing will cancel, unless the -i (ignore errors) parameter
is specified.

The .quftprc file is just a script file that is always run on startup.

I can be contacted at david@dparrish.com, and that's about it.
