This Agreement is displayed for you to read prior to using the Licensed Materials.  If you choose not to accept or agree with these provisions, do not download or install the Licensed Materials.  

Note Regarding Possible Access to Open Source Software:  The Licensed Materials may be bundled with Open Source Software.  "Open Source Software" means any software licensed under terms requiring that (A) other software (“Proprietary Software”) incorporated, combined or distributed with such software or developed using such software: (i) be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or (ii) otherwise be licensed on terms inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to permitting use of the Proprietary Software on or with devices other than TI Devices, or (B) require the owner of Proprietary Software to license any of its patents to users of the Open Source Software and/or Proprietary Software incorporated, combined or distributed with such Open Source Software or developed using such Open Source Software.
